    "# Reverse BODMAS Challenege\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is to develop a Python calculator that evaluates expressions using reverse BODMAS order. The following programming constructs are essential for this task:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For loops\n",
    "- While loops\n",
    "- Functions\n",
    "- If statements\n",
    "- Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completing the basic calculator, you should create a user interface that allows interaction with the calculator. While TKinter is a recommended option for simplicity, other Python GUI frameworks are also viable. Challenge Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not use any GPTs or similar AI tools for assistance.\n",
    "- Ensure you can explain and understand each line of the code you write.\n",
    "- You may utilise Python's built-in mathematical operators.\n",
    "- This project will help reinforce your understanding of fundamental programming concepts and the practical application of Python in developing interactive applications."
