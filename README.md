# Python Educational Materials

*** This Repository is in Progress as I collate all my material ***

This repository contains all of the challenges and solutions I use to train people in learning python. The best course I have found to provide the fundamentals are: 

- Python Overview: https: //www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/lecture/20568984?start=0#overview
- Machine Learning Specific: ttps://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/lecture/5733442?start=0#overview

The challenges I have solutions for are: 

- Reverse BODMAS Calculator
- Palmers Penguins
