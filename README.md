# Python Educational Materials

*** This Repository is in Progress as I collate all my material ***

This repository contains all of the challenges and solutions I use to train people in learning python. The best course I have found to provide the fundamentals are: 

- Python Overview: https: //www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/lecture/20568984?start=0#overview
- Machine Learning Specific: ttps://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/lecture/5733442?start=0#overview

The challenges I have solutions for are: 

- __Python Practice__: Reverse BODMAS Calculator
- __Classification Problem__: Palmers Penguins
- __Univariate Time-Series__: Monthly Sunspots
- __Multivariate Time-Series__: Occupancy Detection Data Set
- __Neural Networks__:

 The additional lessons on various topics include:

 - Python Enviroments: Best practise around python enviroments
 - Object Oreinted Programming: How to structure code so it can be deployed as classes
 - Neural Network Maths: 
 - Transformer Maths:
 - Bayes-Optimisation Maths
